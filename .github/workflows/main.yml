# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: unityci/editor:ubuntu-2019.4.27f1-windows-mono-0.15.0
    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      # Documentation: https://github.com/actions/checkout
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          # The branch, tag or SHA to checkout. When checking out the repository that
          # triggered a workflow, this defaults to the reference or SHA for that event.
          # Otherwise, uses the default branch.
          ref: 'master'
          # Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is configured
          # with the local git config, which enables your scripts to run authenticated git
          # commands. The post-job step removes the PAT.
          #
          # We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary. Also
          # when generating a new PAT, select the least scopes necessary.
